# Waterbear

Current limitations

* No sprites
* No sounds
* No parallel scripts
* No graphics editor
* No load and save
* Minimal IDE
* No hot-loading libraries
* Can't wrap a script fragment as a new block yet
* No variables
* Many Scratch blocks unimplemented
* Scripts not optimized
* Not entirely sure how to encapsulate each script, or how to stop and start scripts cleanly (iframes? replace the .stage element?)

Inherent limitations

* Few types
* Size of scripts can become unwieldy
* Can't convert arbitrary Javascript to blocks (is this inherent or current?)
* Limits to how many blocks a given block can reference (???)
* Fixed number of arguments for a given block
*
