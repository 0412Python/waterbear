Notes:

Each script workspace should be in it's own closure, protected from other namespaces.
Each workspace should have it's own state object for maintaining state between block steps
Each workspace state object should subscribe to mouse and keyboard events to expose those to sensing blocks.
Each workspace has a timer and a frame counter.
