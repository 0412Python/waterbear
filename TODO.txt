# Needed to do for the rethinking branch

* Why are control blocks showing [object Object] in the block menu? (probably because views are getting prematurely converted to jquery objects)
* Convert the Arduino blocks to use new style block definitions
* Move scripts out of blocks on block definition load
* Serialization, including version and plugins
* New dragging library?
* gist library
* Split up plugins (still to go: sketchy, canvas, gamequery, processing)
* UI for selecting plugins
* Test on iPad
