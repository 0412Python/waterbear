# Needed to do for the rethinking branch

* Serialization, including version and plugins, ids for contained items
* Deserialization: rebuild view from serialized version
* Split up plugins (still to go: sketchy, canvas, gamequery, processing)
* gist library
* UI for selecting plugins
* embedding
* New dragging library?
