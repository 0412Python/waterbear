# Needed to do for the rethinking branch

* Fix locals/returns (rebind add_to_script, add_to_workspace, add_to_socket, delete_block events)
* Context blocks should only have one .locals (else, new block)
* Serialization, including version and plugins, ids for contained items
* Deserialization: rebuild view from serialized version
* Rename locals
* Split up plugins (still to go: sketchy, canvas, gamequery, processing)
* gist library
* UI for selecting plugins
* embedding
* New dragging library?
